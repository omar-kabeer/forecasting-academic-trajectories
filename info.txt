https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success
A dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The data is used to build classification models to predict students' dropout and academic sucess. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there is a strong imbalance towards one of the classes.

Information
For what purpose was the dataset created?

The dataset was created in a project that aims to contribute to the reduction of academic dropout and failure in higher education, by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk at an early stage of their academic path, so that strategies to support them can be put into place. 

The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment – academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors. 

The problem is formulated as a three category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course. 

Who funded the creation of the dataset?

This dataset is supported by program SATDAP - Capacitação da Administração Pública under grant POCI-05-5762-FSE-000191, Portugal.

Are there recommended data splits?

The dataset was used, in out project, with a data split of 80% for training and 20% for test.

Was there any data preprocessing performed?

We performed a rigorous data preprocessing to handle data from anomalies, unexplainable outliers, and missing values.

Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?

The dataset was used in a pilot project to provide the tutoring team at our higher education institution with an estimate of the risk of dropout and failure. With this information, the tutoring team provides more accurate help to students.
